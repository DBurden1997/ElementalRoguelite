# ElementalRoguelite

This is my current main project, a roguelite game inpired by games such as Spelunky, Binding of Isaac and others of its ilk, as well as the Legend of Zelda and other ARPGs. The name is not final, but it is called so because you play as an elemental, a character with an affinity for an element such as fire, water or nature.

The goal for the prototype stage of this project is to have the first playable character implemented, a plant elemental, as well as a full randomly generated level with some enemy encounters and a boss. It is very early in development and much can and will change.
